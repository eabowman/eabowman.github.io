# About me

I am a fungal and evolutionary ecologist interested in the development and maintenance of multipartite interactions, as well as the immediate and longterm outcomes of symbiotic relationships (e.g. establishment of symbiosis and nature of symbiotic interaction). Research indicates that host genotype, environment, and the composition of fungal symbiont communities can affect the outcome of symbioses leading to variation in how these microbial communities impact host performance and wider ecosystem processes. Understanding these interactions is integral to discerning ecological and evolutionary patterns within host-symbiont communities, as well as understanding how these interactions will be affected by perturbation, e.g. climate change. 

Currently, I am pursuing my PhD at the University of Arizona where I work with Dr. Betsy Arnold on plant-fungal symbioses. In my doctoral work, I am studying how abiotic and biotic factors related to climate change shape communities of fungal symbionts associated with Ponderosa pine (*Pinus ponderosa*) across isolated montane forests in central and southern Arizona. For this work, I am focusing on ectomycorrhizal and foliar endophytic fungi to link above- and below-ground processes aiming to capture the ecology of tree symbionts in a whole-plant context. I am particularly interested in examining how community disassembly and local variation across these communities may affect the outcomes of these plant-fungal associations. 

Previously, I received a B.S. in Botany from Oregon State University in 2014, before coming to Dr. Arnoldâ€™s lab for a M.S. in fall 2014. After developing an appreciation for both the Sky Islands in Arizona and the outreach the Arnold lab does, I decided to pursue my PhD at the U of A in fall 2016. As of summer 2019, I am a PhD candidate anticipating graduation in Spring 2020.
