Welcome and thank you for visiting my site!

I am a fungal ecologist interested in addressing the interplay of host genotype, environment, and fungal symbiont communities to better understand how these microbial communities impact host performance and wider ecosystem processes. Currently, I am pursuing my PhD at the University of Arizona where I work with Dr. Betsy Arnold on plant-fungal symbioses. 

In my doctoral work, I am studying how abiotic and biotic factors related to climate change shape communities of fungal symbionts associated with Ponderosa pine (*Pinus ponderosa*) across isolated montane forests in central and southern Arizona. Specifically, I am focusing on ectomycorrhizal and foliar endophytic fungi to link above- and below-ground processes aiming to capture the ecology of tree symbionts in a whole-plant context. I am particularly interested in examining how community disassembly and local variation across these communities may affect the outcomes of these plant-fungal associations. 

I received a B.S. in Botany from Oregon State University in 2014, before coming to Dr. Arnoldâ€™s lab for a M.S. in fall 2014. After developing an appreciation for both the Sky Islands in Arizona and the outreach the Arnold lab does, I decided to pursue my PhD at the U of A in fall 2016.
