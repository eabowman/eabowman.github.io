Welcome and thank you for visiting my site!

I am a fungal ecologist interested in addressing the interplay of host genotype, environment, and fungal symbiont communities to better understand the effect of local adaptation on host performance and wider ecosystem processes. Currently, I am pursuring my PhD at the University of Arizona where I work with Dr. Betsy Arnold on plant-fungal symbioses. 

For my dissertation, I am studying how abiotic and biotic factors related to climate change shape communities of fungal symbionts associated with Ponderosa pine (*Pinus ponderosa subsp. scopulorum*) across isolated montane forests in central and southern Arizona. For my project, I am focusing on ectomycorrhizal fungi and foliar endophytic fungi to link above- and below-ground processes providing a whole plant perspective. I am particularly interested in looking at how community disassembly and local variation across these communities may affect the outcome of these plant-fungal symbioses. 

I received a B.S. in Botany from Oregon State University in 2014, before coming to Dr. Arnoldâ€™s lab for a M.S. in fall 2014 and then, because I love the Arnold lab and the research we do in this lab, remaining for a PhD in fall 2016.
